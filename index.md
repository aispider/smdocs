#What is SMART?
SMART provides a unified mechanism for diverse applications to interact with medical-record data. <em>SMART Apps</em>
built against the SMART API can be embedded within any <em>SMART Container</em>. A SMART Container is, most often, an
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system used by physicians, but might also be a Personal Health Record (PHR) such as
[http://indivohealth.org/ Indivo] used by patients, or a data-analytics platform such as [https://www.i2b2.org/ i2b2]
used by researchers.

For example, a SMART app might analyze a person's risk of heart disease based on recent labs and demographic
information. This app can then be deployed on Regenstrief's CareWeb EHR, Children Hospital Boston's Indivo PCHR, or
Harvard Medical School's i2b2 analytics engine. As other EMR vendors adopt the SMART platform, the app's reach increases
''without changing a single line of code''.

#Anatomy of a SMART App

<img src="http://wiki.chip.org/smart-project/images/c/c0/Anatomy-smart-app.png" style="float: right">

A SMART app is a normal web application, embedded as a frame within the SMART Container's user interface, with access to
the SMART API for interacting with health data. A patient, Penny, may use a medication browser app within her PCHR.
Meanwhile, a primary care doctor Dave may use the same app within his clinic-based EMR to view the medications of a
patient scheduled for an appointment next week. Penny's PCHR and Dave's EMR are both SMART containers; they both expose
the SMART API; and they can both display the medication browser app. Though they may function very differently behind
the scenes, they can both embed the exact same medication-list-manager app because they present the same API.
Importantly, in any given user session (Penny's or Dave's), the medication-list-manager is connected to only ''one''
SMART container. 

The screenshots to the right demonstrate the same medication list application running in the context of two different
SMART containers: a simplified EMR, and the analytics platform i2b2.

A SMART app can access the SMART API in two ways:

1. via "SMART Connect", using Javascript calls from our client library
2. via "SMART REST", using OAuth-signed REST calls to a SMART container

Both of these approaches can be used to get at the same underlying data. SMART Connect is for simple applications whose
logic can be completely built in HTML and JavaScript. SMART REST is for applications that may need to perform
significant back-end processing, in particular when using additional external data sources.

Whether you access data via SMART Connect, SMART REST, or a combination, your app will load the
[[Developers_Documentation:_SMART_App_Javascript_Libraries |
SMART App Javascript Libraries]]. In the case of SMART Connect, this library is the sole access point. In the case of
SMART REST, the library provides the OAuth token handoff and medical-record context, which your app can then send back
to its back-end for use in REST calls. 

##SMART Connect

Writing a purely browser-based app in HTML5 and JavaScript is as easy as including the client-side JavaScript libraries
and making API calls!  Keep in mind that SMART Connect calls can only access data while the end-user remains online,
since authentication depends on that user's existing session with the SMART container. If your app needs to access data
from your web application's backend or while the user is offline, you'll need to make some REST calls as well.

##SMART REST

Apps with server-side requirements, or apps that need offline access to the SMART API, use the REST interface, which
exposes data as resources accessible via HTTP GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.  To ensure apps are authorized to access the
resources
they request, the SMART container authenticates each REST API call using OAuth, a scheme by which a SMART container or
user may delegate
access to applications.

The delegation takes the form of a token/secret pair, generated by the SMART container and handed off to the application
(with permission!). After tokens are obtained, each HTTP request is signed using the shared secret.

Writing a SMART REST app requires a bit more work than a SMART Connect app, because the app must be able to:

1.  Interact with the SMART container to obtain tokens
2.  Store tokens securely, maintaining appropriate sessions
3.  Select the appropriate token and sign each SMART REST API call

A few words about #1.  The [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849 OAuth specification] defines a "dance" among three
parties (client app, the server, and the resource owner) enabling the client app to obtain access tokens. SMART REST
apps obtain tokens by a simpler alternative using our JavaScript library, as explained in our tutorials.

To simplify the job of working with SMART REST, we provide client libraries in
[Java](https://github.com/chb/smart_client_java) and [Python](https://github.com/chb/smart_client_python python).

#OK, I'm ready to code
